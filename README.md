# DeleteLongPaths
Delete files and folders that are located in long paths in Windows. 

The reason I made this little tool is because it was a pain trying to get rid of folders on node projects that have the **node_modules** nesting issue.

To prevent the character limit while deleting forlders I used the [AlphaFS](http://alphafs.alphaleonis.com/) set of libraries.

If for some reason you're having issues with the latest. Try the [PowerShell](https://github.com/eliashdezr/DeleteLongPaths/releases/tag/1.1.0) version.


# Performance
Deleting ~72,000 small files and around ~17,000 folders takes ~17 seconds (SSD: PLEXTOR PX-128M3)
